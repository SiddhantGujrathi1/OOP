Name        : Assignment_1
=
Implement a class Complex which represents the Complex Number data type. Implement the following 
 1. Constructor (including a default constructor which creates the complex number 0+0i).
 2. Overloaded operator+ to add two complex numbers.
 3. Overloaded operator* to multiply two complex numbers.
 4. Overloaded << and >> to print and read Complex Numbers


Name        : Assignment_2
=
Develop an object oriented program in C++ to create a database of student information
system containing the following information: Name, Roll number, Class, division, Date of
Birth, Blood group, Contact address, telephone number, driving license no. etc Construct the
database with suitable member functions for initializing and destroying the data viz
constructor, default constructor, Copy constructor, destructor, static member functions, friend
class, this pointer, inline code and dynamic memory allocation operators-new and delete.


Name        : Assignment_3
=
Imagine a publishing company which does marketing for book and audio 
cassette versions. Create a class publication that stores the title 
(a string) and price (type float) of publications. From this class 
derive two classes: book which adds a page count (type int) and tape 
which adds a playing time in minutes (type float). Write a program that 
instantiates the book and tape class, allows user to enter data and displays 
the data members. If an exception is caught, replace all the data member 
values with zero values


Name        : Assignment_4
=
Problem Statement :
Write a C++ program that creates an output file, writes information to it, closes the file and
open it again as an input file and read the information from the file.


Name        : Assignment_5
=
Write a function template selection Sort. Write a program that inputs, sorts and outputs an int array and a float array.

Name        : Assignment_6
=
Use STL for Sorting and searching with user-defined
records such as Person Record (Name, birth date, telephone no).

Name        : Assignment_7
=
Write a program in C++ to use map associative container. The keys will be the names of states,
and the values will be the populations of the states. When the program runs, the user is
prompted to type the name of a state. The program then looks in the map, using the state name as
an index, and returns the population of the state.
